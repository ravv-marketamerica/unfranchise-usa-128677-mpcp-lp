What dates am I working to for Qtr3 Master UnFranchise Owner, is it Q date or calendar?
It is based on calendar quarter, so it runs from 1st July to 30th September. The Master UFO program now works by satisfying the criteria in a calendar quarter and rewards will be given in the following quarter. In summary you satisfy in Qtr3, enjoy rewards in Qtr4, satisfy Qtr4 and enjoy rewards in Qtr1 etc.

I was currently working towards the existing Master Unfranchise owner in Qtr3 – can I still be rewarded on this?
No, the new Master UnFranchise Owner program replaces the previous program. All your BV and sponsors generated from July 1st still count.

I earned rewards from Qtr1 2025 Master Unfranchise Owner program, will I still receive them?
You will still receive these rewards in Qtr3 and Qtr4 2025 (notably free shipping on your own orders above $50, not your customers)

How long will this MPCP promotion last?
The promotion period lasts until December 31st, 2025. We will evaluate this program throughout this period and if it is successful for UFO’s and the company, we will continue. If we encounter any ‘gaming’ we will have no choice but to end the promotion.

Can I participate if I did not attend ICON 2025?
Yes, every UFO is eligible for this, if they are in good standing and satisfy the criteria.

Why and when is the company ending the IBV program for all UnFranchise Owners with home country of US & Canada?
Quite simply, we have created a more lucrative MPCP by doubling commissions in your 001 BDC when satisfying the Master UnFranchise criteria. IBV commissions will cease worldwide for all UnFranchise Owners with home market of US or Canada. The last day to receive IBV on orders is week ending September 26th. The final commission run will be completed in the usual 2 weeks cycle and will be paid on Friday October 10th.

How will the new cashback program work?
There will be a cashback % applied to all partner stores. We are also bringing the ability for an Unfranchise owner to recommend local business to be listed on SHOP.COM. The UFO who recommended the business will be eligible to receive cashback on any purchases from any other UFO at that business. Cashback will be applied to VIFT (digital wallet) as usual. Look out for more details.

What happens to all those products that have IBV?
From October 1st 2025, any applicable Market America products will have BV (e.g. shopping annuity). Any applicable partner store products will have cashback.

Do I have to buy 5 tickets every quarter?
No, but you need to ensure you have 5 tickets for the next major event (so that you are in good standing), all bought from the company. Buying 5 tickets for LS 2026 will mean you are in good standing for Qtr3 and Qtr4 2025. In Qtr1 2026 you will need to have purchased 5 tickets for ICON 2026 by 31st March to satisfy Qtr1 Master UFO criteria.

What happens if I can’t attend Leadership School 2026?
Then you will not satisfy the Master Unfranchise criteria. Any ‘double’ commissions paid in Qtr1 will be clawed back and you won’t be eligible for Master Unfranchise until you attend ICON in Qtr3 2026.

Do my personally sponsored Unfranchise Owners have to be qualified, activated and on Autoship?
They have to be qualified and subscribed to Autoship.

Can I sell tickets to my team?
No, we want you to bring new UnFranchise Owners and prospects to the events. You must purchase tickets directly from the company.

Do all UnFranchise Owners need to change to the new 60/120/180 BV to exercise the monthly accrual option?
Yes, starting October 1st .

If I sponsor a Health Professional (HP) does this count for sponsorship?
Yes, if the new HP is qualified and on autoship in the calendar quarter, then yes this would count towards the sponsorship criteria. HP1, WebCenter Pro Affiliates, and Motives Pro Artists do not count towards sponsorship criteria for the Master UnFranchise Owner program.

How do I track my Master UnFranchise progress?
There will be a new widget added to the UnFranchise homepage. You can also ask CoPilot.
