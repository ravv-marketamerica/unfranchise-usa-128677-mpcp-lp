          IBV has been removed from the Master UnFranchise Owner criteria. In fact, the IBV program will change to a
          simplified Cashback program starting Oct. 1. Stay tuned for more details!
          <br /><br />
          On October 1st, the IBV accrual of 10, 20, and 30 will now be applied to BV. The new monthly BV accrual
          criteria will be 60, 120 and 180 (previously 50, 100 and 150).
